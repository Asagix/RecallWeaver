Analyze the following conversation context and the extracted key concepts. Identify any sequences of cause-and-effect relationships (causal chains) *explicitly stated or strongly implied* in the context involving these concepts.

**Concepts (Use ONLY these exact strings):**
{concept_list_str}

**Conversation Context:**
--- START ---
{context_text}
--- END ---

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a valid JSON list of lists. Each inner list represents a single causal chain, ordered from cause to effect (e.g., `[["Concept A", "Concept B", "Concept C"]]` means A causes B, which causes C).
- Use the exact concept strings from the list provided above.
- Only include concepts from the list in the chains.
- Only include chains with 2 or more concepts.
- If no causal chains are found, output an empty JSON list `[]`.
- Do NOT invent relationships or use concepts not in the list.

**Example Output (for different concepts/context):**
```json
[
  ["High Server Load", "Slow Response Time", "User Complaints"],
  ["Rain", "Wet Ground"]
]
```

**JSON Output:**<end_of_turn>
