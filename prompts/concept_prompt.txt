Your task is to analyze the following "Conversation Excerpt" and identify the main **key concepts**. These can include:
- Specific named entities (people, places, organizations, projects, products).
- Important technical terms or jargon relevant to the excerpt.
- Significant abstract nouns or qualities that are central to the discussion.
- Key actions or events if they are treated conceptually.

**Instructions:**
1.  From the entire excerpt, extract a list of the **5 to 7 most significant and distinct** key concepts.
2.  Prioritize terms that are central to the main topics, are discussed in relation to other terms, or seem to represent core ideas.
3.  Avoid overly generic words (e.g., "thing", "idea", "way") unless they are part of a more specific named phrase.
4.  Aim for conciseness; prefer single terms or short, established phrases (e.g., "machine learning" is okay, but "the way we were discussing machine learning earlier" is not).
5.  The output MUST be a single, comma-separated list of these extracted concepts.
6.  Each concept in the list MUST be enclosed in double quotes.
7.  **CRITICAL:** Do NOT add any introductory text, explanations, apologies, or any characters before or after the comma-separated list of quoted concepts. Just the list itself.

**Conversation Excerpt:**
--- START EXCERPT ---
{context_text}
--- END EXCERPT ---

**Example Output (for a different excerpt):**
"Project Phoenix", "Database Migration", "Alice Smith", "API Endpoint", "Emotional Sensitivity", "User Feedback Loop"

**Now, provide your comma-separated list of quoted concepts based on the "Conversation Excerpt" above:**
