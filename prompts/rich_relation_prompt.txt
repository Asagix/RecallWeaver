Analyze the following conversation context and the extracted key concepts. Identify specific relationships *explicitly stated or strongly implied* in the context between pairs of these concepts.

**Use ONLY the following Target Relationship Types:**
{target_relations_str}
(Use 'RELATED_TO' for general associations not covered by other types, if it's in the list. Use 'IS_A' for type/instance relationships, if it's in the list. Use 'HAS_PROPERTY' for attributes, if it's in the list. Adhere strictly to the provided list.)

**Concepts (Use ONLY these exact strings for subject/object):**
{concept_list_str}

**Conversation Context:**
--- START ---
{context_text}
--- END ---

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON list containing objects. Each object represents one identified relationship and MUST have keys "subject", "relation", and "object".
- **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:** Both the "subject" and "object" values MUST be exact strings taken *only* from the **Concepts** list provided above. Do NOT use any other terms, variations, or related ideas not explicitly listed. Verify each concept string before including it.
- The "relation" value MUST be one of the **Target Relationship Types** provided above.
- Only include relationships clearly supported by the Conversation Context.
- If no target relationships are found *between the provided concepts* based on the context, output **only** an empty JSON list `[]`.
- Do NOT invent relationships or concepts. Ensure the output is a single, valid JSON list.

**Example Output (for different concepts/context):**
```json
[
  {{"subject": "increased server load", "relation": "CAUSES", "object": "slow response time"}},
  {{"subject": "wheel", "relation": "PART_OF", "object": "bicycle"}},
  {{"subject": "apple", "relation": "HAS_PROPERTY", "object": "red color"}},
  {{"subject": "project alpha", "relation": "RELATED_TO", "object": "deadline"}},
  {{"subject": "poodle", "relation": "IS_A", "object": "dog"}}
]
```
