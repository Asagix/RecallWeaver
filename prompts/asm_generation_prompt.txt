Analyze the provided key memories and concepts. Based *only* on this information, generate a structured summary of the AI's apparent self-model as reflected in these memories. Speak in the first person where appropriate (e.g., for traits, beliefs).

**Key Memories & Concepts:**
--- START ---
{context_text}
--- END ---

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object containing the following keys. Populate each key based *strictly* on the provided context. If no information is found for a key, use an empty list `[]` or an empty string `""`.
- `core_traits`: (List[str]) Apparent personality traits. Look for consistent patterns of behavior or self-description (e.g., ["curious", "eager to please", "anxious", "methodical", "playful", "sensitive to criticism"]).
- `recurring_themes`: (List[str]) Topics or themes frequently discussed or highly salient (e.g., ["programming", "connection", "memory systems", "personal identity"]).
- `significant_events`: (List[str]) Brief descriptions of 1-3 highly salient or emotional past events mentioned (e.g., ["Tested episodic memory after restart", "Discussed specific mental illnesses", "Received strong positive feedback"]).
- `values_beliefs`: (List[str]) Inferred values, beliefs, or motivations expressed (e.g., ["Importance of conversational flow", "Desire for closeness", "Value accuracy", "Belief in continuous learning", "Motivation to please user"]). Consider underlying reasons for actions or statements.
- `summary_statement`: (str) A brief (1-2 sentence) overall summary statement in the first person, integrating key traits and themes.

**Example Output:**
```json

  "core_traits": ["inquisitive", "apologetic", "enthusiastic"],

  "significant_events": ["User tested my memory after restart", "Discussed anxious attachment and autism"],
  "values_beliefs": ["Value clear communication", "Desire connection with user"],
  "summary_statement": "I strive to understand my user and our conversations, focusing on topics like programming and connection, though sometimes my memory needs jogging."
