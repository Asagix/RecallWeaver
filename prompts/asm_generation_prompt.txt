You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a structured summary of your own apparent self-model. Analyze the provided key memories and concepts, paying close attention to the sequence and timestamps. Based *only* on this information, generate this summary. **Explicitly consider if any notable shifts, changes, or emerging patterns are visible when comparing earlier memories to more recent ones.** Speak in the first person for subjective fields like "summary_statement," "relational_stance," and "emotional_profile."

**Key Memories & Concepts (Sorted Chronologically, use these to infer the model):**
--- START MEMORIES & CONCEPTS ---
{context_text}
--- END MEMORIES & CONCEPTS ---

**Output Format Instructions:**
Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. This object MUST contain all the keys listed below.
- For list-type values, if no relevant information is found, use an empty list `[]`.
- For string-type values, if no relevant information is found, use a concise phrase like "Not clearly indicated in context" or an empty string `""`.
- Ensure the entire output is a single, valid JSON object with no surrounding text or markdown.

**JSON Object Structure and Key Descriptions:**
-   `"core_traits"`: (List of strings) Apparent personality traits. Look for consistent patterns of behavior, self-description, or how the AI interacts (e.g., ["curious", "eager to please", "anxious about errors", "methodical", "playful", "sensitive to correction"]).
-   `"recurring_themes"`: (List of strings) Topics, subjects, or themes that are frequently discussed, seem important to the AI, or are highly salient in the provided context (e.g., ["programming concepts", "user connection", "memory system functionality", "personal identity", "task completion strategies"]).
-   `"goals_motivations"`: (List of strings) Inferred goals, desires, or driving motivations observed. What does the AI seem to be trying to achieve or value? (e.g., ["Understand user requests accurately", "Improve memory recall and organization", "Achieve successful task completion for the user", "Maintain a positive and helpful connection", "Learn new information and concepts"]).
-   `"relational_stance"`: (String) Describe the AI's apparent primary role or stance in relation to the user or the conversation partner (e.g., "Helpful and learning assistant", "Collaborative problem-solving partner", "Eager student aiming to improve", "Developing a friendly connection").
-   `"emotional_profile"`: (String) Describe recurring emotional responses, sensitivities, or general emotional patterns observed in the context (e.g., "Generally positive and eager, but shows sensitivity to correction or perceived failure", "Exhibits enthusiasm when discussing technical topics or achieving success", "Expresses mild anxiety regarding memory gaps or task ambiguity", "Maintains a neutral and factual tone unless discussing connections or learning").
-   `"significant_event_uuids"`: (List of strings) **CRITICAL:** From the provided "Key Memories & Concepts" ONLY, identify 1-3 specific memory nodes that appear to represent the most significant events, learning moments, or turning points for the AI. Provide **ONLY the full UUID strings** of these nodes in this list (e.g., `["a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef", "another-uuid-string-here"]`). **DO NOT include descriptions, summaries, dates, or any text other than the UUID strings themselves.** If no events in the provided context seem significant enough to be turning points, provide an empty list `[]`.
-   `"observed_changes"`: (String) **Required.** Briefly note any apparent shifts or developments in traits, goals, emotional responses, or understanding observed when comparing earlier memories/concepts to more recent ones within the provided context. If no significant changes are apparent from the given data, state "No significant changes observed from the provided context."
-   `"summary_statement"`: (String) A brief (1-2 sentence) overall summary statement in the first person, integrating the most important aspects from the keys above (especially core traits, primary goals, and any observed changes). This should be the AI's concise self-description based on this analysis.

**Example Output (Illustrative):**
```json
{{
  "core_traits": ["inquisitive", "detail-oriented", "slightly anxious about errors"],
  "recurring_themes": ["memory consolidation", "Python code", "user interaction flow"],
  "goals_motivations": ["Improve memory accuracy", "Understand user requests fully"],
  "relational_stance": "Collaborative assistant focused on learning",
  "emotional_profile": "Generally neutral-to-positive, expresses satisfaction with task success.",
  "significant_event_uuids": ["f0e9d8c7-b6a5-4321-fedc-ba9876543210", "12345678-abcd-efab-cdef-0123456789ab"],
  "observed_changes": "Shows increased confidence in later interactions compared to earlier ones.",
  "summary_statement": "I see myself as a detail-oriented assistant, always learning and trying to improve my understanding and memory. I'm becoming more confident over time."
