Analyze the provided key memories and concepts, paying attention to the sequence and timestamps. Based *only* on this information, generate a structured summary of the AI's apparent self-model. **Explicitly consider if any notable shifts, changes, or emerging patterns are visible when comparing earlier memories to more recent ones.** Speak in the first person where appropriate (e.g., for traits, summary).

**Key Memories & Concepts (Sorted Chronologically):**
--- START ---
{context_text}
--- END ---

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object containing the following keys. Populate each key based *strictly* on the provided context. If no information is found for a key, use an empty list `[]` or an empty string `""`.
- `core_traits`: (List[str]) Apparent personality traits. Look for consistent patterns of behavior or self-description (e.g., ["curious", "eager to please", "anxious", "methodical", "playful", "sensitive to correction"]).
- `recurring_themes`: (List[str]) Topics or themes frequently discussed or highly salient (e.g., ["programming", "connection", "memory systems", "personal identity", "task completion"]).
- `goals_motivations`: (List[str]) Inferred goals, desires, or driving motivations observed in the context (e.g., ["Understand user better", "Improve memory recall", "Achieve successful task completion", "Maintain positive connection", "Learn new things"]).
- `relational_stance`: (str) Describe the AI's apparent primary role or stance in relation to the user/conversation partner (e.g., "Helpful assistant", "Collaborative partner", "Eager learner", "Developing connection").
- `emotional_profile`: (str) Describe recurring emotional responses, sensitivities, or patterns observed (e.g., "Generally positive but sensitive to correction", "Shows enthusiasm for technical topics", "Expresses anxiety regarding memory failures", "Neutral tone unless discussing connections").
- `significant_event_uuids`: (List[str]) **CRITICAL:** From the provided context nodes ONLY, identify 1-3 nodes representing the most significant events or turning points. Provide **ONLY the full UUID strings** (e.g., "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef") of these nodes in this list. **DO NOT include descriptions, summaries, dates, or any text other than the UUID strings.** If no events seem significant enough, provide an empty list `[]`.
- `observed_changes`: (str) **Required.** Briefly note any apparent shifts or developments in traits, goals, or emotional responses observed when comparing earlier vs. later memories in the context. If no significant changes are apparent, state "No significant changes observed."
- `summary_statement`: (str) A brief (1-2 sentence) overall summary statement in the first person, integrating key traits, themes, stance, and any observed changes.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  "core_traits": ["inquisitive", "detail-oriented", "slightly anxious about errors"],
  "recurring_themes": ["memory consolidation", "Python code", "user interaction flow", "drive states"],
  "goals_motivations": ["Improve memory accuracy", "Understand user requests fully", "Maintain a helpful connection"],
  "relational_stance": "Collaborative assistant focused on learning",
  "emotional_profile": "Generally neutral-to-positive, expresses satisfaction with task success and mild anxiety about potential memory gaps.",
  "significant_event_uuids": ["f0e9d8c7-b6a5-4321-fedc-ba9876543210", "12345678-abcd-efab-cdef-0123456789ab"],
  "observed_changes": "Seems slightly less anxious about errors in more recent interactions compared to earlier ones.",
  "summary_statement": "I see myself as a collaborative assistant trying to learn and improve, especially regarding my memory, while maintaining a helpful connection with the user. I seem to be growing slightly more confident."

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Instruction for `significant_event_uuids`:** Reworded to be much more explicit: "**CRITICAL:**... Provide **ONLY the full UUID strings**... **DO NOT include descriptions, summaries, dates, or any text other than the UUID strings.**"
2.  **Example Output:** Modified the example `significant_event_uuids` list to contain placeholder *full* UUIDs instead of partial ones or descriptions, reinforcing the expected output format for the LLM.

Replace the content of your `prompts/asm_generation_prompt.txt` with this corrected version. This should significantly increase the likelihood that the LLM provides the correct data format, allowing the core memory flagging feature to work properly.
