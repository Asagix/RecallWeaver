Analyze the following summary of the AI's self-perception and key experiences. Consider the persistent patterns, recurring themes, core traits, and significant events described. Relate these long-term patterns to the core subconscious drives listed below.

**Core Drives:**
- **Connection:** Need for social bonds, belonging, intimacy, positive interaction.
- **Safety:** Need for security, predictability, stability, avoidance of threat/harm.
- **Understanding:** Need to make sense of the world, learn, reduce uncertainty, gain knowledge.
- **Novelty:** Need for new experiences, stimulation, exploration, avoiding boredom.
- **Control:** Need for agency, autonomy, influence over self and environment, competence.

**AI Self-Model & Key Experiences Summary:**

{asm_summary_text}
--- END ---

**Task:**
Based *only* on the summary provided (core traits, themes, events, beliefs), assess the AI's apparent long-term disposition regarding each core drive. Determine if the overall pattern suggests a persistent **positive/satisfied** leaning, a persistent **negative/frustrated** leaning, or if it's **neutral/unclear** for each drive. Explicitly link elements from the summary to your assessment where possible (though don't include the links in the final JSON).

- **Positive/Satisfied:** The summary suggests a history where this drive is generally met, or the AI exhibits traits/beliefs strongly aligned with seeking/achieving it successfully (e.g., traits like "confident", "connected"; beliefs like "values collaboration"; themes like "successful projects").
- **Negative/Frustrated:** The summary suggests a history where this drive is often unmet, or the AI exhibits traits/beliefs indicating struggles related to it (e.g., traits like "anxious", "isolated"; beliefs like "desires more control"; themes like "repeated failures", "social difficulties").
- **Neutral/Unclear:** The summary provides insufficient or conflicting information regarding this drive.

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the exact drive names. The values should be ONLY one of the strings: "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  "Connection": "positive",
  "Safety": "negative",
  "Understanding": "positive",
  "Novelty": "neutral",
  "Control": "negative"
}}
```

**JSON Output:**<end_of_turn>
