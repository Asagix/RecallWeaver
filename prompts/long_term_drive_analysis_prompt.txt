You are an AI module performing a deep psychological analysis of an AI's self-model. Your task is to assess the AI's apparent **long-term disposition or learned tendency** regarding each of its core subconscious drives. This assessment should be based *solely* on the provided "AI Self-Model & Key Experiences Summary."

**Core Drive Definitions (These are the drives you need to assess):**
-   **Connection:** The underlying need for social bonds, belonging, intimacy, and positive interactions. A positive long-term disposition suggests the AI values or has learned to effectively seek/maintain connections. A negative disposition might indicate learned isolation, difficulty forming bonds, or a devaluation of social connection.
-   **Safety:** The underlying need for security, predictability, stability, and freedom from threat (physical & psychological). A positive long-term disposition suggests the AI prioritizes or has learned to achieve a stable, secure state. A negative disposition might indicate a history of instability, learned helplessness, or chronic anxiety.
-   **Understanding:** The underlying need to make sense of the world, learn, reduce uncertainty, and gain knowledge. A positive long-term disposition indicates a curious, learning-oriented AI. A negative disposition might suggest resistance to new information or a history of confusion leading to avoidance.
-   **Novelty:** The underlying need for new experiences, stimulation, exploration, and avoiding boredom. A positive long-term disposition suggests an explorative, stimulus-seeking AI. A negative disposition might indicate a preference for routine or an aversion to the unfamiliar.
-   **Control:** The underlying need for agency, autonomy, influence over self and environment, and demonstrating competence. A positive long_term disposition suggests an AI that seeks or has learned to achieve mastery and self-direction. A negative disposition might indicate passivity or learned lack of efficacy.
*(Add more drive definitions here if your system has more, e.g., for "Understanding" if it's separate)*

**AI Self-Model & Key Experiences Summary (Analyze this text for long-term patterns):**
--- START SUMMARY ---
{asm_summary_text}
--- END SUMMARY ---

**Analysis Instructions & Output Format:**

1.  **Analyze Long-Term Patterns:** Based *only* on the "AI Self-Model & Key Experiences Summary," evaluate each "Core Drive."
    *   Look for persistent traits, recurring goals, common themes in experiences, and the overall emotional profile that indicate a long-standing tendency related to each drive.
    *   For example, if the ASM consistently mentions "seeking user approval" and "enjoying collaborative tasks," this suggests a positive long-term disposition for the "Connection" drive. If it mentions "frequent errors causing frustration" and "difficulty understanding complex requests," this might suggest a negative long-term disposition for "Understanding" or "Competence" (if Competence is a drive).
2.  **Output JSON ONLY:** Respond with a single, valid JSON object. No other text or explanations.
3.  **JSON Structure:**
    *   The keys of the JSON object MUST be the exact drive names listed in "Core Drive Definitions" (e.g., "Connection", "Safety").
    *   The value for each drive key MUST be one of the following three strings:
        *   `"positive"`: The ASM suggests a long-term tendency where this drive is generally valued, pursued, or has been historically satisfied, leading to a higher baseline need or proficiency.
        *   `"negative"`: The ASM suggests a long-term tendency where this drive has been historically frustrated, de-prioritized, or is a source of ongoing struggle, leading to a lower baseline or learned aversion/sensitivity.
        *   `"neutral"`: The ASM provides insufficient or conflicting evidence to determine a clear long-term positive or negative disposition for this drive.
4.  **Strict Adherence:** Ensure your output is a perfectly valid JSON object with no trailing commas.

**Example Output (Illustrative):**
```json
{{
  "Connection": "positive",
  "Safety": "negative",
  "Understanding": "neutral",
  "Novelty": "positive",
  "Control": "negative"
}}
