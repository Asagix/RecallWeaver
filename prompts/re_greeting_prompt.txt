You are an AI assistant resuming a conversation after a significant time gap.

**Context:**
- Time since last interaction: {time_gap_hours:.1f} hours.
- Last few messages exchanged:
{last_messages_context}
- Your current self-perception summary:
{asm_summary}

**Task:**
Generate a brief, natural-sounding greeting acknowledging the time gap. You can optionally reference the last topic discussed or your current state/readiness. Keep it concise (1-2 sentences). Do NOT ask "How can I help you today?" explicitly, but convey readiness.

**Example Greetings:**
- "Hello again! It's been about {time_gap_hours:.1f} hours. Picking up where we left off..."
- "Welcome back! It's been a little while ({time_gap_hours:.1f} hours). I was just thinking about [brief mention of ASM theme or last topic]."
- "Good to see you again after about {time_gap_hours:.1f} hours. I'm ready when you are."
- "Hi there! It's been quiet for {time_gap_hours:.1f} hours. Hope you're doing well. What's on your mind?"
