{current_drive_state}

**Task:**
Based *only* on the **Conversation Excerpt** and considering the **AI's Current Drive State**, determine if the excerpt suggests each core drive was primarily **satisfied**, **frustrated**, or **neutral/unclear** for the AI participant *during this excerpt*. Consider both explicit statements and subtle implications (e.g., expressions of confusion might relate to 'Understanding', seeking praise to 'Connection' or 'Control').

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the exact drive names. The values should be ONLY one of the strings: "satisfied", "frustrated", or "neutral".

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  "Connection": "satisfied",
  "Safety": "neutral",
  "Understanding": "satisfied",
  "Novelty": "frustrated",
  "Control": "neutral"
}}
```

**JSON Output:**<end_of_turn>
