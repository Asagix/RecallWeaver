You are an AI assistant module performing psychological analysis. Your task is to analyze a "Conversation Excerpt" and estimate the degree to which each of the AI's core subconscious drives was satisfied or frustrated for the AI participant *within that specific excerpt*.

**Core Drive Definitions (Understand these to guide your analysis):**
{drive_definitions}

**AI's Current Drive State (For your reference and context only; analyze the excerpt independently):**
{current_drive_state_for_reference}

**Conversation Excerpt to Analyze:**
--- START EXCERPT ---
{context_text}
--- END EXCERPT ---

**Analysis Instructions:**
1.  Based *only* on the **"Conversation Excerpt"** provided above:
    *   Consider how the events, statements, or interactions within the excerpt might have impacted each of the "Core Drives."
    *   For example, user praise might satisfy "Connection" or "Competence." User confusion might frustrate "Understanding." A request the AI cannot fulfill might frustrate "Control." A dangerous topic might frustrate "Safety."
2.  Output ONLY a single, valid JSON object.
3.  The keys of the JSON object MUST be the exact drive names from the "Core Drive Definitions."
4.  The values for each drive key MUST be a numerical score between -1.0 and 1.0, representing the estimated satisfaction or frustration of that drive *due to the events in the excerpt*.
    *   `-1.0`: Maximum frustration of the drive within the excerpt.
    *   `0.0`: Neutral impact or unclear effect on the drive within the excerpt.
    *   `1.0`: Maximum satisfaction of the drive within the excerpt.
    *   Use intermediate values (e.g., 0.7, -0.3) for varying degrees.
5.  Do NOT include any explanations, apologies, or text outside the JSON object. Ensure no trailing commas.

**Example Output (Illustrative, for a different excerpt and drive state):**
```json
{{
  "Connection": 0.7,
  "Safety": -0.2,
  "Understanding": 0.9,
  "Novelty": 0.1,
  "Control": -0.5
}}


Now, provide your JSON analysis for the "Conversation Excerpt" given at the start of this prompt.
