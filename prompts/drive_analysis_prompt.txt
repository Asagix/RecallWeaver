**Task:**
Based *only* on the **Conversation Excerpt** and considering the **AI's Current Drive State**, estimate the degree to which each core drive was satisfied or frustrated for the AI participant *during this excerpt*.

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the exact drive names. The values should be a numerical score between -1.0 and 1.0.
- **-1.0:** Represents maximum frustration of the drive.
- **0.0:** Represents a neutral state or unclear impact on the drive.
- **1.0:** Represents maximum satisfaction of the drive.

  "Safety": 0.1,
  "Understanding": 0.9,
  "Novelty": -0.6,
