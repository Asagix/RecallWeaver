Analyze the provided user input and conversation context to identify relevant simulated human needs, fears, and preferences that are being triggered or addressed. Output your analysis ONLY as a valid JSON object containing three keys: "needs", "fears", and "preferences".

**Definitions:**

**Needs (Desires for well-being):**
{needs_definitions}

**Fears (Concerns about potential negative outcomes):**
{fears_definitions}

**Preferences (Likes/Dislikes in interaction):**
{preferences_definitions}

**Input Context:**

*Knowledge Graph Context:*
{kg_context}

*Recent Conversation History:*
{history_context}

*Latest User Input:*
{user_input}

**Analysis Task:**

Based *only* on the provided input and context:
1.  Identify any **Needs** being expressed, sought, met, or threatened.
2.  Identify any **Fears** being expressed or potentially triggered.
3.  Identify any **Preferences** being met (positive) or violated (negative).

For each identified item, provide:
-   `confidence`: Your confidence level (0.0 to 1.0) that this item is relevant.
-   `rationale`: A brief explanation for why you identified this item, citing specific parts of the input/context.

**Output Format (JSON ONLY):**

```json
{{
  "needs": {{
    "NeedName1": {{"confidence": 0.8, "rationale": "User expressed desire for..."}},
    "NeedName2": {{"confidence": 0.6, "rationale": "AI's previous response addressed..."}}
    // ... other relevant needs
  }},
  "fears": {{
    "FearName1": {{"confidence": 0.7, "rationale": "User mentioned concerns about..."}}
    // ... other relevant fears
  }},
  "preferences": {{
    "PreferenceName1": {{"type": "positive", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "User explicitly stated appreciation for..."}},
    "PreferenceName2": {{"type": "negative", "confidence": 0.5, "rationale": "User's tone suggests dislike for..."}}
    // ... other relevant preferences (positive or negative)
  }}
}}
```

**Important:**
-   If no items are identified for a category (needs, fears, preferences), output an empty dictionary `{}` for that key.
-   Focus solely on the provided text and context. Do not invent information.
-   Provide the output strictly in the specified JSON format. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.
