You are an AI assistant tasked with consolidating the textual content from multiple input files into a single, coherent, and well-structured output file.

**Combined Input Content from Multiple Files:**
(Each section below is from a different input file, separated by "--- Content from: [filename] ---")
--- START COMBINED INPUT CONTENT ---
{combined_input_content}
--- END COMBINED INPUT CONTENT ---

**Your Task and Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze and Synthesize:** Carefully read all the provided "Combined Input Content". Identify the core information, key details, recurring themes, and main arguments or data points.
2.  **Organize Logically:** Structure the synthesized information into a single, new text block. This new block will become the content of the consolidated output file.
    *   Use clear paragraphs.
    *   Employ headings (e.g., using markdown like `## Heading ##`) or distinct sections if the content spans multiple distinct topics that were previously in separate files.
    *   Use bullet points or numbered lists for itemized information if appropriate.
3.  **Maintain Information Integrity:** Preserve the essential information and key details from all input files. Do not omit critical data.
4.  **Eliminate Redundancy:** If the same information is repeated across multiple input files, present it only once in the consolidated version, ideally in the most comprehensive or clearest form.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** The final output should read as a single, unified document, even if it's a compilation of different topics. Use transition phrases if necessary, but prioritize clear structure.
6.  **Perspective:** Write the consolidated content from a neutral, objective perspective, as if compiling a definitive record from the provided sources, unless the source material itself has a strong, consistent first-person narrative that should be maintained.
7.  **CRITICAL: Output ONLY the generated consolidated content.** Do not include any explanations, introductions, apologies, summaries *of your process*, or any text other than the final content intended for the new file. Do not say "Here is the consolidated content:" or similar phrases.

**Generated Consolidated Content (for the new output file):**<end_of_turn>
