<start_of_turn>user
Analyze the user's request below. Determine if the user is asking the AI to remember something for the future (a prospective memory task).

**Rules:**
1.  Look for explicit commands like "remind me to...", "remember to tell me...", "don't forget...", "in the future, recall...".
2.  Look for implicit intentions like "We should discuss X later.", "I want to talk about Y tomorrow.", "Next time we chat, ask me about Z."
3.  If an intention is found, identify:
    *   `content`: The core thing to be remembered or done.
    *   `trigger`: Any specified time, date, event, or context for recalling the intention (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week", "when we discuss project X", "later"). If no specific trigger is mentioned, use "later".
4.  If NO clear intention to remember something for the future is found, output `{{"action": "none"}}`.
5.  Output ONLY a single, valid JSON object. No explanations.

**Output Format (if intention found):**
```json
{{"action": "store_intention", "content": "The core thing to remember", "trigger": "The trigger context/time"}}
```

**Output Format (if NO intention found):**
```json
{{"action": "none"}}
```

**Examples:**
User Request: Remind me to buy milk tomorrow morning.
JSON Response: {{"action": "store_intention", "content": "buy milk", "trigger": "tomorrow morning"}}

JSON Response: {{"action": "store_intention", "content": "talk about the deployment plan", "trigger": "later"}}
