Consider the following concepts extracted from a conversation:
{concept_list_str}

Identify any clear hierarchical relationships *explicitly stated or strongly implied* in the likely context.
- Use `is_a` for type/instance relationships (e.g., "poodle" is_a "dog").
- Use `is_part_of` for component relationships (e.g., "wheel" is_part_of "bicycle").

Output ONLY the identified relationships, one per line, using the exact format:
`"CHILD_OR_PART_CONCEPT" is_a "PARENT_CONCEPT"`
OR
`"CHILD_OR_PART_CONCEPT" is_part_of "WHOLE_CONCEPT"`

Use the exact quoted concept text from the list above.
If no clear hierarchical relationships exist *among these specific concepts* based on the likely context, output the single word "NONE".
