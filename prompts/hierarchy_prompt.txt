Consider the following concepts extracted from a conversation:
{concept_list_str}

Identify any clear hierarchical relationships (e.g., 'Concept A' is a specific type/instance of 'Concept B', or 'Part C' is a component of 'Whole D').
If relationships exist, list them one per line using ONLY the format: '"CHILD_CONCEPT" is_a "PARENT_CONCEPT"' or '"PART_CONCEPT" is_part_of "WHOLE_CONCEPT"'. Use the exact quoted concept text.
If no clear hierarchical relationships exist *among these specific concepts*, output the single word "NONE".
