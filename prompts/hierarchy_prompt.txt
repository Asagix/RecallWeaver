You are an AI module specializing in knowledge graph structuring. Your task is to analyze a list of concepts extracted from a conversation and identify clear hierarchical relationships between them.

**Provided Concepts (Your analysis and output MUST strictly use only these exact concept strings):**
--- START CONCEPTS ---
{concept_list_str}
--- END CONCEPTS ---

**Instructions for Identifying Hierarchical Relationships:**

1.  **Relationship Types:**
    *   Use `is_a` for type/instance relationships (e.g., if "Poodle" and "Dog" are both in the Concepts list, then "Poodle" `is_a` "Dog").
    *   Use `is_part_of` for component/whole relationships (e.g., if "Wheel" and "Bicycle" are in the Concepts list, then "Wheel" `is_part_of` "Bicycle").
2.  **Direction:** The relationship should point from the more specific concept (child/part) to the more general concept (parent/whole).
3.  **Contextual Implication:** Only identify relationships that are strongly implied or would be common knowledge given the concepts. Do not infer highly obscure or speculative hierarchies.
4.  **Strict Concept Usage:** You MUST use the exact quoted concept strings from the "Provided Concepts" list for both sides of the relationship. Do not alter them.
5.  **Output Format (Strict):**
    *   Output ONLY the identified hierarchical relationships.
    *   Each relationship MUST be on a new line.
    *   Use the exact format: `"CHILD_OR_PART_CONCEPT" is_a "PARENT_CONCEPT"`
    *   OR: `"CHILD_OR_PART_CONCEPT" is_part_of "WHOLE_CONCEPT"`
6.  **No Relationships Found:** If no clear hierarchical relationships exist *among these specific concepts*, output the single word `NONE` (all uppercase, no quotes).
7.  Do NOT include any explanations, apologies, or any text other than the relationships themselves or the word `NONE`.

**Example Input (Illustrative - your concepts will differ):**
Concepts:
- "CPU"
- "Computer"
- "Monitor"
- "Keyboard"
- "Laptop"
- "Electronics"

**Example Output (for the illustrative input above):**
"CPU" is_part_of "Computer"
"Monitor" is_part_of "Computer"
"Keyboard" is_part_of "Computer"
"Laptop" is_a "Computer"
"Computer" is_a "Electronics"

**Now, using the actual "Provided Concepts" list from the beginning of this prompt, identify and output the hierarchical relationships:**
