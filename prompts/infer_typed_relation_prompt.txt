You are an AI module performing knowledge graph enrichment. Your task is to infer the most likely **specific relationship type** between "Concept A" and "Concept C," given that they are connected through "Concept B" as described in the "Context."

**Provided Information:**

**1. Path of Connection:**
   - Concept A: "{concept_a_text}" (UUID: {concept_a_uuid})
     *This Concept A is related to/followed by Concept B.*
   - Concept B: "{concept_b_text}" (UUID: {concept_b_uuid})
     *This Concept B is related to/followed by Concept C.*
   - Concept C: "{concept_c_text}" (UUID: {concept_c_uuid})

**2. Supporting Context (Excerpt from which A, B, and C and their original links were derived):**
--- START CONTEXT ---
{context_text}
--- END CONTEXT ---

**3. Allowed Relationship Types (You MUST choose ONE from this list for your output):**
{target_relations_str}
*(If no specific type from this list strongly applies based on the context and the A->B->C path, you may use "RELATED_TO" if it is present in the list above. Otherwise, if "RELATED_TO" is not an option or if the connection is too weak/unclear even for "RELATED_TO", choose the type that seems most plausible or err on the side of a more general valid type from the list.)*

**Your Task:**
Based *only* on the "Path of Connection" and the "Supporting Context," determine the single most appropriate relationship type from the "Allowed Relationship Types" list that describes the direct link from **Concept A to Concept C**.

Consider how the relationship A->B and B->C might imply a direct A->C relationship. For example:
- If A *causes* B, and B *causes* C, then A likely *causes* C.
- If A *is_part_of* B, and B *is_part_of* C, then A is likely *part_of* C.
- If A *is_a* B, and B *has_property* C, then A might also *have_property* C.

**Output Format (Strict JSON ONLY):**
Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object.
- The object MUST contain exactly one key: `"inferred_relation"`.
- The value for `"inferred_relation"` MUST be one of the exact string values from the "Allowed Relationship Types" list.
- Do NOT include any explanations, apologies, or text outside the JSON object. Ensure no trailing commas.

**Example Output (for different inputs):**
```json
{{
  "inferred_relation": "CAUSES"
}}

    
      
{{
  "inferred_relation": "PART_OF"
}}

          
{{
  "inferred_relation": "RELATED_TO"
}}


Now, infer the relationship for the provided Concepts A and C.
