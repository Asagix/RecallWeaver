Analyze the following conversation context and the extracted key concepts. Identify any analogies *explicitly stated or strongly implied* where one concept is compared to another (e.g., "Concept A is like Concept B", "Concept X functions similarly to Concept Y").

**Concepts (Use ONLY these exact strings):**
{concept_list_str}

**Conversation Context:**
--- START ---
{context_text}
--- END ---

**Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a valid JSON list of lists. Each inner list represents one identified analogy and MUST contain exactly two concept strings `[["Concept A", "Concept B"]]`, indicating A is analogous to B.
- Use the exact concept strings from the list provided above.
- Only include concepts from the list in the pairs.
- **CRITICAL:** If no analogies are found between the provided concepts based on the context, output **only** an empty JSON list `[]`.
- Do NOT invent analogies or use concepts not in the list.
- Ensure the output is a single, valid JSON list of lists.

**Example Output (for different concepts/context):**
```json
[
  ["Memory System", "Filing Cabinet"],
  ["Neural Network", "Brain"]
]
```

**JSON Output:**<end_of_turn>
