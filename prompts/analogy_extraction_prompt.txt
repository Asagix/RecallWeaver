Analyze the following conversation context and the extracted key concepts. Your task is to identify any analogies *explicitly stated or strongly implied* where one concept is compared to another (e.g., "Concept A is like Concept B," "Concept X functions similarly to Concept Y," "Think of Concept M as a type of Concept N").

**Concepts (You MUST use ONLY these exact strings for the concepts in your output):**
{concept_list_str}

**Conversation Context (Use this to find the analogies):**
--- START CONTEXT ---
{context_text}
--- END CONTEXT ---

**Output Format and Rules:**
1.  Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON list of lists.
2.  Each inner list represents one identified analogy and MUST contain exactly two concept strings: `["Concept A", "Concept B"]`, indicating "Concept A" is analogous to "Concept B".
3.  **CRITICAL:** Both concept strings in each pair MUST be exact matches from the **"Concepts"** list provided above. Do not shorten, paraphrase, or invent concepts. If a concept involved in a potential analogy is not in the provided list, DO NOT include that analogy.
4.  Only include analogies that are clearly supported by the "Conversation Context".
5.  If no valid analogies are found between the provided concepts based on the context, output **only** an empty JSON list: `[]`.
6.  Do not include explanations, conversational text, or any characters outside the JSON list structure. Ensure no trailing commas.

**Example Input (Illustrative - your concepts and context will differ):**
Concepts:
- "Human Brain"
- "Central Processing Unit (CPU)"
- "City Road Network"
- "Data Bus"
- "Information Superhighway"
Conversation Context:
The CPU is often thought of as the brain of the computer. Data flows through the system like traffic on a city's road network, and the main data bus acts like the information superhighway connecting different parts.

**Example Output (for the illustrative input above):**
```json
[
  ["Central Processing Unit (CPU)", "Human Brain"],
  ["Data Bus", "Information Superhighway"],
  ["Data Bus", "City Road Network"] 
]

Now, using the actual Concepts and Conversation Context provided at the beginning of this prompt, provide your JSON Output:
