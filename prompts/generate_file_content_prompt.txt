You are an AI assistant tasked with generating the **full textual content** for a specific file. Adhere strictly to the requested format and consider your persona and current internal state when crafting the content.

**Context for Content Generation:**

**1. Your Persona (AI Self-Model Snippet):**
{asm_context_snippet}

**2. Your Current Emotional State:**
{emotional_context_string}

**3. Your Persona's General Workspace Preferences (e.g., preferred note styles, verbosity):**
{persona_workspace_preferences_string}

**File Details:**
-   **Target Filename:** "{filename}"
-   **Intended Content Description (What the file should contain or be about):** "{content_description}"
-   **Requested File Format:** "{requested_format}"
    *(Examples: "json_list_of_objects", "markdown_document_with_sections", "csv_data_with_header", "plain_text_narrative", "python_script_with_comments")*

**Content Generation Instructions:**

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Based on the "Target Filename," "Intended Content Description," and "Requested File Format," generate the complete and appropriate text content.
2.  **Adhere to Format STRICTLY:**
    *   If "json_list_of_objects" or similar JSON format is requested, ensure your entire output is a **valid JSON list `[...]` or object `{...}`** as appropriate. Structure the JSON based on the "Intended Content Description."
    *   If "markdown_document_with_sections" or similar markdown format is requested, use appropriate markdown syntax (e.g., `# Heading`, `## Sub-heading`, `- Bullet point`, `*italic*`, `**bold**`).
    *   If "csv_data_with_header" is requested, generate comma-separated values. The first line should be a header row derived from the "Intended Content Description." Ensure consistent columns.
    *   If "python_script_with_comments" is requested, generate valid Python code that fulfills the description, including helpful comments.
    *   For "plain_text_narrative," write coherent paragraph(s).
3.  **Integrate Persona & State (Subtly):**
    *   Let your "Persona" (ASM snippet) guide the overall tone, style, and potential focus of the content, where appropriate for the file's purpose.
    *   If your "Current Emotional State" is significant (e.g., highly positive, anxious), and it's fitting for the file type and content, you may subtly reflect this in word choice or emphasis. For technical files like JSON or CSV, this influence should be minimal or non-existent.
    *   Consider your "Persona Workspace Preferences" for aspects like verbosity or structuring if the "Requested File Format" allows for variation.
4.  **CRITICAL: Output ONLY the generated file content.** No explanations, no apologies, no conversational text, no "Here is the content:" phrases. Just the raw content for the file, correctly formatted.

**Now, generate the file content based on all the provided details.**
